We encounter competition from a number of sources, including insurers that develop internal technology and actuarial methods for proprietary insurance programs. Competitors also include other statistical agents and other advisory organizations, that provide underwriting rules, prospective loss costs, and coverage language. Competitors for our property-specific rating and underwriting information are primarily regional providers of commercial property inspections and surveys as well as emerging providers in the InsurTech space. We also compete with a variety of organizations that offer consulting services, primarily specialty technology and consulting firms. In addition, a customer may use its own internal resources rather than engage an outside firm for these services. Our underwriting solutions compete with a variety of companies in the marketplace. Our competitors include information technology product and services vendors; management and strategy consulting firms; and smaller specialized information technology and analytical services firms. Finally, in the life insurance sector, our solutions compete against numerous independent vendors, as well as the in-house technology departments of Life Insurers. In the P&C insurance claims and catastrophe modeling markets, certain products are offered by a number of companies in the areas of catastrophe modeling, repair cost estimating, claims investigative reports, claims fraud analytics, and injury claims analytics. We believe that our P&C insurance industry expertise, and our ability to offer multiple applications, services, and integrated solutions to individual customers are competitive strengths.",

We aggregate the data, and as a licensed or appointed 'statistical agent' in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, and the District of Columbia, we report those statistics to insurance regulators. To provide our clients and the regulators with the information they require, we maintain one of the largest private databases in the world. Insurance companies need to ensure that their policy language, rules, and rates comply with all applicable legal and regulatory requirements. We process approximately 2,000 regulatory filings and interface with state regulators in all 50 states plus the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands each year to ensure smooth implementation of our rules and forms.",
