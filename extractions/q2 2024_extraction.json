            "response_text": "Good morning and thank you, Manav, for the question. I appreciate the focus on the 8% two-year stack growth rate, because I think it does give broader context beyond what we experienced in this quarter. To answer your question, the drivers of that have been, generally speaking, more demand for our products from the industry as they are facing a variety of the challenges on the underwriting side, on the claim side, the value of what we have been providing to them, but also, and I think this is the element that is the sustainable aspect of it, is the success that we've had in increasing our value capture from the investments that we have made across the business.\n\nAnd this is something I referenced in the earlier comments. We are hearing it repeatedly from clients that they recognize the innovations, the investments that we have made, and that's enabling us in this environment to capture more of that value. And we believe that that is a longer term trend that will enable us to continue to meet that growth. Supplemented by new products and new innovations that we are adding, we continue to see strong growth in our especially business solutions area, where we've We've been innovating with our Whitespace space platform, which has those very strong network effects. We have continued to see growth in our international businesses, which is a penetration opportunity for us, and growth in our life insurance business.\n\nSo as we said at Investor Day, we have core strength where we are adding value and capturing that value in pricing, and that's supplemented by new penetration opportunities that we believe will sustain that growth over time. And then I'd finally add that the elevated strategic dialogue that we have accomplished with our clients is opening up new opportunities to provide our products on a broader enterprise and global basis to our clients. Last week, I had two CEO-level calls, visits, where we spoke about how we can help improve the consistency of the data and the analytics that they are using across their organizations for some portions that aren't utilizing our data or our analytics. And I think that is a structural and relationship benefit that we've been able to achieve and we'll see continued support on the growth, in our growth from those aspects.\n\nYou know, on the trans-sub transition, it's happening in a variety of ways. Some of it is structural, some of it is episodic. I think that it will be a diminishing impact over time. had some stronger elements that contributed to that dynamic in this quarter and made for some of the more pronounced differentiation between subscription growth and transaction growth.",

This is in the investor presentation that we had provided on the website. What we were experiencing was a very high level of shopping activity in auto as a function of rising rates within that business. You can look at the commentary that we had, it was kind of truly an exceptional level of shopping activity that was driving that transaction element. In addition, as you will see in the description around the claims business, we were experiencing still a high level of weather-related claims activity that was also driving that business. And so that's really what is contributing to what we are experiencing as a relatively tough comparison enhanced by some of the transaction to subscription migrations that are more pronounced in this quarter. As we think about that element on an ongoing basis, I think we generally expect that our transactional, our transactional growth rates are ones that are generally at our broader growth rates to slightly higher, because in many cases, they represent some of our higher growth businesses that tend to have more of a transactional aspect at the early stage.

We don't try to predict the weather, but that inherent variability for some of the mechanical factors, for example, the conversion of transactional to subscription, that can have a one-year – that effect can persist for a full year after a subscription locks in. So, I just want to flag, you know, we do expect tough comparisons for the balance of the year on that transactional revenue side.",

You're right that we have, you know, previously talked about this in the context of our Claims Essential Bundle, where there was a targeted effort for a certain customer segment. I would say, as you hear us talk now more broadly across the business, we are seeing it in a number of different businesses where customers are on a pilot and choose to lock that in for a longer term subscription, or they have a subscription with overage tiers and as their business grows, they lock into a higher subscription so that they have more visibility into their own price point. So those are trends that we will continue see across the business, over time you've still seen that subscription transactional mix of our revenues be fairly steady at 80-20-ish. And probably as some of our transactional customers convert into subscription, at the same time we will have new and introductory products or new markets that we're entering where it's more common to enter it in a transactional basis.

Naturally, our largest clients receive a lot of focus because of their sophistication, and their specific needs, but to your point, we want to make certain that we are delivering value for the entire insurance ecosystem.\n\nOne thing that I would say, again, specific to the small and the mid-sized clients is that proportionally, they receive a greater value from the scale that we are able to deliver to them, both from an operational standpoint and from the value of the data that we provide to them, because often they have a lower share of access to overall loss costs or general information. I think they benefit more from the scale competitiveness that we provide them in a variety of claim solutions. And we have not seen any evidence of higher levels of attrition or disintermediation of that range of clients within our business. And that is something that we've watched and we've asked the question around.\n\nI think one or two points that I would make supplementally is that a lot of our clients, while they are interested in new ideas, the risk of taking on a new small private technology vendor is something that they think about very carefully because they have to know that some firm that they can rely on over the long term. This is clearly an advantage for us because of our stability, our reliability. And to that end, we have also been working, as we've talked about kind of most significantly in the claims area, of finding ways to deliver some of those new technology providers by integrating them into our systems and platforms so that our clients can receive the benefit of that, but also with greater confidence that we have vetted and are supporting and integrating those products into our overall systems. So I really appreciate the perspective. It's not something that we have observed in terms of the behavior of our clients. Obviously, I think a much bigger impact is occasionally our clients decide to leave a line of business or leave a state. That will have more influence and we haven't seen any pattern of clients in the smaller, the mid-size that have been leaving to another technology provider.",

So just kind of taking into account or trying to eliminate the impact of that migration between subs and trans. I wanted to point out that our overall revenue growth over that two-year period at 8% was still at the high end of that range.\n\nI think the thing that I would say further is that there was a specific significant contract that as a function of the renewal of that contract and some of the regulatory aspects of how that needed to be approved had to be characterized as transactional in the prior year and was a subscription is now on the subscription side. So that is an element. We're not going to quantify that within it, but I would characterize that as a kind of a specific situation that added to the weakness in the subscription growth. And beyond that, we have other, I'm sorry, the weakness in the transactional growth there. So, you know, this was last year revenue from a contractual standpoint was transactional and now that that contract has been confirmed and executed is now subscription. So that is an element. In addition to what I think you can look at those historical transactional growth rates in the second quarter of 2023 and see a normalization more to that longer term growth rate. So those are the elements. We don't think it makes sense to break all of those pieces apart, but hopefully it's clear enough that you had some seasonal highs or cyclical highs in that prior year quarter plus some structural elements that were contributing to an exceptional tough comparison on the transactional revenue growth.",

Since 20 to 25% of Verisk revenues come from contracts that have premium growth as a direct input and price increases, but often with a two-year lag, does this basically insulate there into 2027, even if 2025 was kind of the pricing key for insurance companies?

On the question of the insurance cycle, look, we've talked over time about being in a hard market broadly in the property and casualty industry that's hitting different segments, certainly at different times, but we know it's not going to last forever. So, you know, it's a when, not an if, that hard market begins to peak and becomes more competitive. I think one of the strengths of Verisk, you have seen us continue to grow historically through both hard markets and softer markets in the insurance cycle. I would not go so far as to say we are insulated. I think the pressure remains on us to continue to deliver value to our clients through all the innovations and product strengths that we've talked about on the call. So I think if we continue to do that, we will continue to deliver value to our customers and continue to grow revenue throughout the cycle.",

You know, as we think about your 3 to 4% pricing target that you said they are investor day, do you think you're positioned to be at the higher end of that or even above based on what you're seeing?

As I mentioned in my earlier comments, the fundamental dynamic almost regardless of the premium growth, which does I think influence it in some cases directly to a modest impact, but also from a psychological standpoint, it's helpful, but even with those two, if we aren't providing value to our clients and they don't perceive that value, then that's where we are going to run into challenges in improving pricing and driving the revenue. You know, that's why the value of the investments that we have made in our core lines business and with our reimagined initiative, while one example of how we are driving value is what's critical, is the most critical factor in what sustains our revenue growth. And that's where we continue to get very strong feedback for how we are helping our clients improve the value of what they're doing.

Yeah, you know, look on the core lines, a reimagined site, our engagement with our customers has really demonstrated the value of our content and the upcoming innovations that we have is delivering additional value for them. So for example, the feedback has been very encouraging across the spectrum of our customers, large and small. They're seeing additional value in the new insights like the experience index, the executive insights, as well as the new technology innovations that we have around the delivery of our content, which is creating efficiencies for them. And so what we are hearing from our customers is these new insights is helping them be better in terms of reacting to market conditions and these new efficiency tools are helping them to be more efficient in their operations. So it has been, it's been very good. I would also say that we've been flexible in terms of how we deliver our content. So some of our smaller customers like the packaged insights and the turnkey solutions. And our larger customers prefer some of the access to underlying components to our analytics so that they can create more differentiation. And so by being flexible, we're benefiting all our customers.\n\nAnd Heather, to give you two specific examples, one product innovation has been the update to our Mozart product, which allows our clients to manage their policy forms much more efficiently because they have thousands of forms based upon product line and state and different product areas. It is a very time-consuming, laborious process to keep those updated, particularly if they reference our ISO policy forms. And so the investment that we've made is effectively in a document management platform that allows them to do that much more easily and more quickly. That's one dimension where they clearly see significant value increase. Another, as we've talked about, is on the experience index. This is where they have asked us to move further beyond those traditional loss costs that we provide to them in the underwriting process and give them a more current read on what's happening, what we see evolving. And so we are able to provide them more actionable information on a more timely basis that provides value to them on the underwriting side, just to kind of tie that down to some specific products that we've been investing in.",

One important thing that I will point to, of course, from a growth perspective, we always look year over year, but it is interesting also to look on a sequential basis this quarter relative to the first quarter. Our total revenues grew relative to the first quarter, and in fact, our transactional revenues also grew relative to the first quarter. So, it's just the year over year that has that pattern. Now, there's some seasonality in things that hit the second quarter typically, and that were particularly strong in the second quarter of last year, and the ones that we called out were the weather impact, which was historically strong in the second quarter of last year, the auto shopping activity for which we've anniversaried that tough comp, and then the transition of transactional revenues to subscription.",

So, what we're hearing from customers is this is a very good innovation. We've launched it for the the homeowner's line of business. The most frequent comment I hear is, when are you going to launch the other lines of businesses? We're excited about it and we're going to continue launching other lines of business.

So this is an opportunity to improve the currency and the actionability of that data set. Now, the other thing that's important is that the client is also asking for more data, which means that there's an implicit desire on their part to give us more data so that we can expand and develop it. So that in and of itself creates more value for us. And we've seen a variety of initiatives and appetite from the clients in the access and surplus area, which for insurance industry analysts will recognize has been a growing area of industry underwriting. The second theme that we heard was more insights. And we talked about the emerging issues, providing greater insights from the data on what the trends are that are taking place. And so that has been a key enhancement. And then the final theme that we heard from clients is connecting the ecosystem. They want us to be that central provider building that network aspect so as to improve the efficiency that the overall system and their ease of operating within that. So all of these elements I share because they're reflections not entirely of us saying, this is what the industry needs, but what we are hearing from clients that they expect from us given our role, given our centrality and the data sets that we have.",

So is it fair that maybe that added 70 pips this quarter, and maybe the core growth was more in the mid-sevens? Any help would be helpful since people are clearly asking.",

So just kind of taking into account or trying to eliminate the impact of that migration between subs and trans. I wanted to point out that our overall revenue growth over that two-year period at 8% was still at the high end of that range... We're not going to quantify that within it, but I would characterize that as a kind of a specific situation that added to the weakness in the subscription growth.",
