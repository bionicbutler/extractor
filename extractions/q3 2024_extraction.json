        "question": "just given where we are in the year, I'm trying to think of through the dynamics for 2025. So, I think there was 10% net written premium growth in the industry in 2023, so the part that's tied to your premiums should be pretty strong, and transactional has pretty easy comps over the next four quarters. And then it seems like extreme events and life and international are going really well. So I guess my question is, is 2025 setting up for an outsized year of growth or are there any headwinds that we should be thinking about?",
        "answer": "Yeah, as we think about 2025, I think you've articulated well the tailwinds that we see in the business, the subscription momentum that we feel and the continued strong premium environment. As we think about potential headwinds that could offset it, you know, we are going into the third year of elevated premium growth, and so that is a longer cycle that the pricing momentum can feel those challenges. I think another element, we are in an environment where the carriers are very focused on their profitability. They're evaluating lines of business and which ones that they are in, as well as evaluating their overall spend. So that is one element of headwind. And then finally, you could start to see a normalization of attrition, which has been a boost for us over the last couple of years. So those are some of the headwinds. Then as an unknown, there is the weather factor. But in general, as we think about it, we do see strong momentum in the business.",

        "question": "Is there a way for us to estimate the tailwinds from the hurricanes Helene and Milton in 4Q, but also the tailwinds for the property estimating solution going forward?",
        "answer": "Yeah, thanks, Ashish. So as we think about the fourth quarter, and both Helene and Milton hit in the fourth quarter, Helene was the very end of September, Milton obviously in early October. It is early to tell and quantify the impact to us. You can look at the estimates of insured losses that have been published. Verisk's estimates, which our extreme events business has published, had insured losses estimated at $6 billion to $11 billion for Helene and $30 billion to $50 billion for Hurricane Milton. As you look at those combined, you could say on average they're similar to Hurricane Ian. But the flow through to us can vary based on the number of assignments, the type of peril, whether it's wind or flood, the overall area covered by the storms. And from what we're seeing, it does take time for the claim to actually be filed as everyone there is focused on getting those communities back on their feet. The other thing I do want to put in context is you think about the impact of those storms in the fourth quarter. You've heard us talk in general across the business about converting contracts from transactional to subscriptions and from customers increasing their usage and committing to higher tiers. And that's happening in this property estimating solutions business as well. We've seen customers increasing their usages and then adapting their subscription contracts to reflect that higher usage. So how that could play out over time could mean less transactional swings on the impact of one single storm proportionally because the customers may be less likely to be in overage. So that transition to subscription has in general been a win-win for our business, and you've seen it play out in our subscription growth.",

        "answer": "Thanks for the question, Kelsey. Yeah, as we looked at, you're right, we've seen accelerating subscription growth even sequentially from last quarter. When you really look at it, it isn't any one thing or one area of our business. Obviously, we've now called out and quantified the impact of the contract conversion. But the underlying subscription growth really hits across all of our businesses. The drivers are the ones that we really highlighted in the prepared remarks. It's the two factors, our focus go-to-market and customer client engagement, and then the strengths being driven by our product development and innovation. And those two things are supported by the tailwind of premium growth. But in general, what you're seeing is the momentum from new sales, from conversions to subscription, and from upsizing usage and adding products from Verisk.",

        "question": "As we think about just the current health of the insurance companies and all of the change that's kind of pending, how do we think about this idea that insurance companies are trying to enter this period of much more focused profitability and you see what's going on in Florida, California, some of the topics that we've talked about in the past. How are you guys assessing that, I don't want to call it a headwind, but just that transition that the industry seems to be going under in this part of the cycle?",
        "answer": "Yeah. So, Inder, thank you very much for the question. I particularly value the context and looking at the industry as a whole, which as you know, we spend a lot of time thinking about. And so, from our perspective, I think when you look at the premium growth, you look at of the improvements in the combined ratios and overall profitability of the business, and particularly in light of the significant storms and some of the hits that the industry has taken, I think it's a reflection of continued interest in the data and the analytics that we provide to them to make better risk decisions, which will continue to be a driver of opportunity for us, because we can gather that information, we can apply analytical methods across, that can be utilized across the industry, but also to your point in terms of moving into this more focused profitability dimension, our work to identify where we can improve their internal processes by automating more of their functions, integrating data into the workflow has been a very active component of those higher level enterprise discussions that we're having. And it's a conversation that is happening at the chief information officer level and the CEO level or the heads of business that are interested in improving their process. And then a second element of that is how do we integrate external parties that are part of the insurance ecosystem in what they're doing to improve overall efficiency. A great example of that is what we have been doing in London with our Whitespace space platform, where we are integrating brokers and underwriters to both improve the efficiency of that interaction, but also improving the data quality that the underwriters are utilizing to make placement decisions. So I think everything that you are describing encourages continued engagement with us on finding and developing those solutions.",

And you know I think you talked about the new initiative called the future of form so should we expect that to be sort of a continuing you know or a similar level of value driver as we look ahead to 25 and beyond.",
        "answer": "Yeah, absolutely. So thanks for the question, Faiza. I think you had asked three things. I think you would ask three things. So first, in terms of where we are with the program, we are slightly more than halfway through the program as we think about the investment and where we are in terms of bringing new innovations to the customers. Second, you talked about, you know, how do we think about KPIs and how do we think about KPIs internally about the program? You know, one of the things we look at is the number of new insights that we're bringing to market and the number of new insights that customers are benefiting from. So we've talked about the experience index where we've now launched that for five out of the six major lines of business. We'll launch the sixth one next year. The future of forms that we talked about, we started with our major general liability update. We expect that to become part of our major updates going forward. So you will see that next year as we bring in new updates to our BOP program. You're gonna see that. So that is a continuous innovation that we're gonna bring to market. And one thing that I just wanna highlight that brings it all together for us as we think about customers and their engagement, we have a new engagement platform at core.bears.com. And we're highlighting that to our customers. And what we're seeing is as we're putting these new content and our existing content on this new platform, the engagement level is multiple times what we had previously. So we're excited that these new innovations are driving usage at our customers, which as you know, drives the value for us from CoreLine's perspective.",

Just clarify that, please.",

        "answer": "Yeah, Jeff, thanks for the question. Yes, they are trending well. That subscription growth is a function of strength overall, strength in acquiring new customers, strength in selling all of the factors we talked about, cross-sell and up-sell, and adding some of our new products and data sets. You know, I would broaden it to say, I think, you know, we are, the sales results have been strong relative to our expectations kind of given this performance, and I think reflective of some of the changes that we made in our go-to-market strategy, focusing some of our territories, changing incentives, making some adjustments there, coupled with the higher-level engagement which is opening up opportunities for us to make a more value-driven sale at a senior level. And so it's a complementary impact of that higher senior-level engagement and then more effective follow-up and engagement on the sales front.",

Like, are you – is the customer buying more off? I understand there's probably a pricing element because it's upgraded, but just some help there just to visualize that would be helpful.",
        "answer": "Yeah, thanks for the question, Manav. You know, for Core Lines Reimagine, there isn't exactly a volume component per se, so we're referring more to addition of new data sets, you know, particularly in the underwriting data and analytic solutions business, as well as there's some growth products affiliated with Core Lines Reimagine, things like electronic ratings content and other ratings of the service.

Where are those wins coming from? What specifically. is driving that increased interest from clients. Then also, within that, are those competitive takeaways or are those taking advantage of Whitespace space on the extreme event front?",
        "answer": "Yes. Thanks for the question, Andrew. Of those 10 new customers, nine of them are new to the modeling space entirely. I think this shows and reflects the broader interest of adding, you know, more specific modeling information around the climate change and climate impacts that we're seeing. And I called out specifically some of the segments including, you know, excess and surplus lines of insurance and the managing general agents, which has been a significant growth area in the insurance industry. You know, and focusing on those areas is something that has driven strength across our business, that the extreme events business has seen that as well. Yeah, good morning, Elizabeth. I'll just add to the point that, obviously, there have been heightened catastrophe loss activity for the past several years, as we've referenced in past calls. Helene and Milton have already been mentioned, and you see an increasing number of market participants looking to better understand and quantify the risk from these events, and that's driving interest extreme event modeling solutions.",

As you know, you've heard us call out over the past, boy, five, six quarters now, the strength in the auto shopping activity, and more generally the transactional revenue growth in our auto insurance data business.

And so, the puts and takes that we're talking about in the quarter are all kind of small relative to that, but happy to walk you through those in order. You know, on the margin, we called out for this quarter the 60 basis point FX benefit, which was not in our, not complicated in the guidance range, nor do we forecast that for the fourth quarter. We leave that to the currency traders, I guess. The interest expense I called out was 32 million this quarter, up from 29 the year previous. You could think of that as a reasonable run rate. Possibly over time, I suppose the net interest expense would go up as interest rates earned on cash balances could come down.

        "answer": "Yeah. Thanks. Thanks for the question, Russell. Yes. We've seen strength actually in a number of our international businesses. I think we called out the life, health and travel business, which continues to expand into new regions and being pulled there by their customers. So that's seen strong growth. You know, our Ofsta business in Canada contributed as well to that growth. I think Lee talked about some of the integration of some of the Verisk datasets there. So that's a good example of synergies and strength from the Verisk overall business contributing to one of our international acquisitions. So all of those are factors for good growth and our claims businesses in Germany have been doing well as well. So yes, that is an area where we will continue to look for potential acquisitions.
