            "response_text": "Sure, Manav. Thank you very much. You know, the start of your question really captures one of the key strategic dimensions that we see with the AccuLynx merger. First, that the property estimating solutions business while founded originally on providing that estimate of damage has really evolved into a very valuable network that connects insurers and contractors, third-party administrators, remediation specialists, adjusters, and importantly, policyholders. And the AccuLynx component, given the exceptionally strong platform that they have built for roofers, allows us to extend and integrate that network with a core component of insurance-related repairs. There is high overlap between our customers. AccuLynx has over 5,000 customers, and we believe that over half of those, we also have relationships with our property estimating solutions business. That gives you some sense of the overlap that we have and our ability to improve the connectivity that we have.\n\nNow, that then leads to the synergy opportunity. The immediate opportunities are identifying those AccuLynx customers that are not utilizing our property estimating solutions business, as well as conversely, contractors that are on the PES system that have the ability to utilize the Xactware suite of products. Those are immediate opportunities given the synergies between both of them. In addition, as we referred to, it's not just the network element, but there is a significant benefit in the very precise roofing materials and operating costs that we can utilize with our insurance client base. As recently as I think within the past three months, I had a meeting with a major insurance company CEO who asked specifically can you provide more detailed, more current and relevant data on the roofing front? And this clearly addresses that. And then beyond that, while AccuLynx is focused on the roofing dimension, we believe that there is also applicability to water mitigation and other specialized elements of the repair and restoration function.

We're very proud of the results that we delivered in the first half of the year. As we look ahead to the second-half of the year, we do see a balanced outlook here. And a couple things that we are keeping our eyes on. First of all, there's the comps versus last year and the second-half of 2024. Specifically, there were the storms in the fourth quarter of '24 that we called out with the hurricanes there. Also over the course of the second-half of '24, was really accelerating subscription revenue. Some of that came from some strong renewals. That means that we're lapping that strong growth and present the headwind on the growth factors this year. That's the first area on the comps. \n\nThe second factors that we're looking at are some known factors that we called out in the remarks there. Things that developments since we provided the first outlook at the beginning of '25, I called out specifically on the federal government contract front. That is contained, but that is a known factor that will start hitting us in the third quarter. And then we also called out specifically in the auto business, more generally, sort of some short-term impacts in our UDAS business, including those auto factors with some competitive pressure there, as well as some pressure on insurers from the situation in California, moderating some of their discretionary spend. So those are the known factors. We then there are a couple of unknown factors like attrition and weather activities, transactional volumes in our international businesses. But that, as we look ahead, are some of the things affecting us in the second-half.\n\nI will just finish that by saying that the core value in the business and the strength of the business remains strong. Yeah, and the full year outlook at still 6 to 8% organic is very consistent with our overall guidance.",

And so while we can say that this is clearly a strong SaaS platform, that element of connectivity for the client and tying together their internal processes, as well as serving as a means to integrate that contractor into a broader ecosystem in the restoration and repair function, connecting contractors, adjusters, and insurers in that process is a natural fit. You also may be aware from our past comments that our extreme events business is in the process of a migration to a SaaS platform, which will facilitate the efficiency and the speed and compute capability of a lot of our modeling businesses.

But from my standpoint, the growth dynamic has been that AccuLynx really developed a specialized SaaS integrated service platform that was specifically focused on the roofing function. Its founder was originally a roofer, and knew that business well, and they have successfully penetrated that roofing business, which is, as you can imagine, a very large business, and by creating a competitively differentiated product specialized to the needs of that particular function. So there continues to be a significant opportunity to penetrate that opportunity as well as you add more value to that function, then that creates more value for the roofer and then sustains overall pricing benefit. To give you a sense of our estimate of the TAM for that roofing sector as it exists on its own, it's approximately a $2 billion TAM. And as we've conveyed, AccuLynx is looking at approximately 150 million in 2025 revenue. So it gives you a sense of the ongoing penetration opportunity. But Aaron, perhaps on in terms of ongoing growth and the opportunity that we see in conjunction with the property estimating solutions, perhaps you can give Jeff some additional color.",

It was something that we looked at very carefully to understand that. And we brought in a third-party consultant to evaluate that for us and then applying our own knowledge. And we found that there's actually relatively low cyclicality, that the roofing and repair business is more driven by just the overall home stock, which, as you can imagine from a scale standpoint is much more significant and it's a massive market when you think about the number of residential homes.

We will have two elements of investment in the business. One is building out some of the public company functions as they join the Verisk family, but the second and the more important is really to continue to build behind the revenue synergies and the product development opportunities that we see to combine it with the property estimating solution suite of products. To give some confidence on that, we've highlighted that the business is a accretive to Verisk from an overall margin standpoint, and we expect to be able to maintain that.",

And as you noted, for the portion of our contracts that are tied to these annual premium growth, that impact will be lagged. However, more of our revenue is tied to longer-term contracts and where we -- when we are renewing these contracts, our customers are projecting that slowdown, we are architecting long-term deals to incorporate both this growth period as well as this slower growth period. So we offer clients that stability over long terms of their contracts, and it enables us to have more pricing visibility. I'd also add that, look, premium is one component of our pricing.

I think the biggest -- the most important element to our ability to have outperformed has been investing in and communicating and realizing the incremental value for our clients from the investments that we've made across the businesses. We've seen that most clearly in the investment that we made in our Core Lines Reimagine program to increase their usability of the data, the efficiency of their process. We've heard this not only directly, but indirectly from an investor that was doing their own diligence and spoke to multiple of our clients to see if they were getting value out of it.\n\nAnd it was consistently very positive. I think that, that has also been added by the fact that our engagement at a senior level has allowed us to better articulate the value that we provide to them and understand where we can be making investments that are very relevant to what we're doing. I mentioned before that I had the meeting with an insurance company CEO who emphasized the roofing data element of improving that roofing data component. And so that was clearly a factor that we considered in the merits of this acquisition. So that's what I would cite as probably the most important contributor to the overall growth in our business.",

And then to dimensionalize that and map that against the factors, Andrew, that you were qualifying, I think as we think about our build, that engagement and that value delivery has enabled us to deliver at the high end of the range or in some, occasionally, above the range on the factors of pricing as we highlight the value on the factors of cross-sell and upsell as well as the fact that attrition has been lower. So I think those 3 factors have really contributed to the strong recent strength. As I think I highlighted in the near term, those create a short-term tough comp.

So, that is something that we do not expect to be very active in the second-half of the year. And as you look at first half, second-half comps, that would be a headwind. On the international transactional activity, that is a bit more difficult to predict. It was a benefit in the second quarter from a comparability standpoint. The activity may be less in the second-half, so that's a bit weather and volume dependent. As we think about transactional activity overall in the second quarter, we also have the headwinds from the – sorry, I'm sorry – transactional activity in the second-half. We will have the headwinds from the storm comparison, from some of the underwriting data and analytic solutions pressure that I highlighted before, and though at a lower level than before.

First of all, there's the comps versus last year and the second-half of 2024. Specifically, there were the storms in the fourth quarter of '24 that we called out with the hurricanes there. Also over the course of the second-half of '24, was really accelerating subscription revenue. Some of that came from some strong renewals. That means that we're lapping that strong growth and present the headwind on the growth factors this year.",

It's an area where we have competed successfully, but from time to time, we do face greater pressures in that area. But it's one where we continue to work to find dimensions of our other businesses where we can supplement what we do, for instance, by tying claims-related data to underwriting data and providing innovative solutions on that front. But it is an area, even while it's less than 10% of our total business in our auto-related businesses, but it's one where we are subject to occasional competitive pressure.",
